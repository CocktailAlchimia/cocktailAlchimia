## Cocktail Alchimia
#### https://cocktailalchimia.netlify.app/

A team project developed remotely during the Web Development course at Wild Code School - Lisbon by Margarida Sousa, Fernanda Abbud, Roxy Pursey and Isadora Haas.

### The Idea
Our idea was to create an app where users could search for cocktails recipes by the name of the drinks or by an ingredient, using what they have in their fridge. For this second project we were given the challenge to build a dynamic webapp that uses data coming from an API. We chose to work with TheCocktailDB API and the app was designed to be responsive. 

### 
Our name-Cocktail Alchimia, was inspired by the word alchemy, the medievil word for chemistry - a magical process of transformation,creation & combination. The graphic elements were created to give a lab feel of experitmenting and discovery.
For the colour pallette we used neon colours which is associated with night life, fun and free.

### The Development
We used scrum methodology, drew wireframes to organise our ideas, created a Trello Board to manage the sprints. There were twelve components in total and some of them reused across the app. We setup the GitHub environment using Git, created branches and split work among ourselves. We used Visual Code Studio to write the code, collaborating in LiveShare whenever we had to resolve merge conflicts or connect different components.

### Our Role
We worked together on the brainstorm, wireframes, setup the GitHub and Trello environment. We split the coding among ourselves by components and we worked a together remotely, solving problems, brainstorming about the best way of solving problems and fixing bugs. The presentation was made by all team members to our colleagues, instructors and campus director on May 15th, 2020.
